=====================================
Equivalent Pharmaceutical ID Standard
=====================================

The Equivalent Pharmaceutical ID (EPID) outlines how EPID data is formatted.


--------
Overview
--------

The EPID Standard defines how medications and equivalent medications are 
defined and named.

A **medication** refers to a single pharmaceutical product for medical use. It
may include one or more ingredients and a single dosage form. Ingredients have 
a single strength.

A group of medications are grouped under an **equivalent medication**. All
medications under an equivalent medication will have the same ingredients and
strengths. There may be one or more dosage forms.

------------
Introduction
------------

The EPID Standard follows the following guiding principles for development:

- Wherever possible, the International Nonproprietary Names (INN) is used for
  the naming of ingredients.

----------
Versioning
----------

The EPID uses a MAJOR.MINOR versioning system. Versions refer to the EPID
Standard and **not** updates to the actual EPID data. Between minor versions,
there should be minimal changes required by the end user. Between major 
versions, there will be moderate to significant changes required by the end 
user.
