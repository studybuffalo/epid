# Equivalent Pharmaceutical ID
The Equivalent Pharmaceutical ID (EPID) is an ID system used to group related pharmaceutical products together and provide a normalized system for naming. The EPID is intended to be used in healthcare applications to allow regional medication databases to be normalized to a non-branded/trade name product.
