Equivalent Pharmaceutical ID
============================

The Equivalent Pharmaceutical ID (EPID) is a pharmaceutical classification
system to group related pharmaceutical products together and provide a 
normalized system for naming.

The EPID is designed to provide a ready-to-use database of pharmaceutical
products that can be used by health care providers as-is. To accomplish this,
the EPID classification system follows a set of style guidelines that is 
generalizable wherever possible and opinionated when needed.
