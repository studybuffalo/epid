Equivalent Pharmaceutical ID
============================

The Equivalent Pharmaceutical ID (EPID) is a pharmaceutical classification
system to group related pharmaceutical products together and provide a 
normalized system for naming.

The EPID is designed to provide a ready-to-use database of pharmaceutical
products that can be used by health care providers as-is. To accomplish this,
the EPID classification system follows a set of style guidelines that is 
generalizable wherever possible and opinionated when needed.

EPID Standard

The structure and format of the EPID is defined by the EPID Standard.

Versioning
----------

The EPID uses a MAJOR.MINOR versioning system. Versions refer to the EPID
Standard and **not** updates to the actual EPID data. Between minor versions,
there should be minimal changes required by the end user. Between major 
versions, there will be moderate to significant changes required by the end 
user.
